Practice task for local storage (level-2):
S-1: HTML file will have a p tag and a button
S-2: The p tag will show "the count" which is initially 0. (initially the value in local storage is 0)
S-3: Every time, after clicking the button, the number will be increased by 1. & the result will be shown in the p tag.
S-4: With every click on the button, the result will be stored in the local storage also.
